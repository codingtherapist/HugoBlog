## Hi, I'm Africa!
 ### I am a web developer, accessibility specialist and former occupational therapist. 

I enjoy:
* community building, blogging and content creation
* creating dynamic, human centered web applications that focus on user wellness
* advocating for the well-being of developers and end users
* working with technology to increase accessibility for neuro-typical individuals + those with cognitive, physical, +/ emotional needs <br><br>


üå± My skills:
* Building responsive full stack web applications using Javascript and Nodejs
* Build RESTful API's using the MERN stack
* Robust knowledge of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 - W3C<br><br>

‚ö° Fun fact: One of the reasons I transitioned from the therapy field to technology is because I became more interested in problem-solving how to make the virtual therapy tools I was using better and more accessible (streamlining documentation tools, building therapeutic gaming rooms, etc).<br><br>

üìΩÔ∏è I share yoga tips for computer users, as well as talk about my journey merging therapy and technology on my YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/user/africakenyah<br><br>

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on <br>
  - The Web Accessibility Pocket Guide. This API will display a database of WCAG 2.1 guidelines for web accessibility. This resource will include WCAG rules searchable by section and topic to be displayed from a backend database.<b> HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL and hosted on Heroku</b>.

  - A [5-minute stretch break web application](https://africakenyah.com/portfolio) for developers and computer users.   This site is being built with <b>HMTL, CSS, Javascript, nodejs and MongoDB</b>. An API to retrieve yoga poses from a database categorized by body parts will be added using nodejs, express, and mongoDB.
  - A [full-stack CRUD web application](https://africakenyah.com/portfolio) for uploading silent mental, emotional or physical health diagnoses and treatment tips anonymously. This site is being built using <b>HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and hosted on Netlify</b>.<br><br>

üí¨ Ask me:
* for yoga tips for developers
* about my fascination with assistive technology 
* about human centered design and universal design
* about ergonomics (standing desks and specialized keyboards/ mice have saved my life!)<br><br>
