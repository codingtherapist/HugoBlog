# Hi, I'm Africa!
 ## I am a web developer, accessibility specialist and former occupational therapist. 
 ![cartoon of author with hands overhead infront of a laptop](/images/floaty.gif)

## I enjoy:
* community building, blogging and content creation
* creating dynamic, human centered web applications that focus on user wellness
* advocating for the well-being of developers and end users
* working with technology to increase accessibility for neuro-typical individuals + those with cognitive, physical, +/ emotional needs <br><br>


## üå± My skills:
* Building responsive full stack web applications using Javascript and Nodejs
* Build RESTful API's using the MERN stack
* Robust knowledge of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 - W3C<br><br>

## üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on <br>

  - A [5-minute stretch break web application](https://africakenyah.com/portfolio) for developers and computer users.   This site is being built with <b>HMTL, CSS, Javascript, nodejs and MongoDB</b>. An API to retrieve yoga poses from a database categorized by body parts will be added using nodejs, express, and mongoDB.

  - Contributing to building [Accessible For All](https://github.com/AccessibleForAll). This open source project is a community dedicated to making the web more accessible for everyone, starting with educating designers and developers on accessibility best practices from an early stage.

## üí¨ Ask me about:
* stretch break tips for tech workers
* my fascination with assistive technology 
* human centered design and universal design
* ergonomics (standing desks and specialized keyboards/ mice have saved my life!)<br><br>

## ‚ö° Fun fact: 
One of the reasons I transitioned from the therapy field to technology is because I became interested in how the web worked with the assisitive technology my students and patients were using. <br><br>

## üìΩÔ∏è I share 
yoga tips for computer users, as well as talk about my journey merging therapy and technology on my YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/user/africakenyah<br><br>
