# Intro to Web Accessibility Testing Part 2

This is a 4 part live series on web accessibility covering automated and manual testing of web pages for web developers. Every  Thursday at 12pm on Twitch :)

In this stream, we review web accessibility principles and work on making buttons and links accessible. We cover the assisitive technology tree using google light house accessibility tools, keyboard only considerations and live code a few buttons and links to make them easier to use for color blind users and keyboard only users.  

Note: the video starts around the 10 minute mark.
