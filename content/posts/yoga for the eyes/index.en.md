# 4 Minute Eye Break: Yoga for Computer Eye Strain

Does anyone else find their eyes feeling achy after too much screen time (leisure and work-related)? Try this relaxing eye refresher! These eye exercises are great for those who spend a lot of time on their phones or computers.

These movements will also help strengthen your eyes while also giving them a moment to rest with calming sensory input. 
 I hope this helps 👁💙
