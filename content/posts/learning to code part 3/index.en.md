# 100daysofcode Restart Part 3 (days 1-27)

I can't believe today was my last day as an occupational therapist providing direct care! I am so excited to start learning full time and commit 100%.

* FINALLY USED AN API AND GOT IT TO WORK 

## Day 25-26 
* Catching up on #100devs hw including a very long build of a simple full-stack app via watching @ mayanwolfe’s 6hr vod, she is so fun to watch!

## Day 27  
* 3 hr silent code & study w some #100devs baddies
* Connected MongoDB to my local server and learned a little about databases
* Messed around w terminal and Github using vscode
* Uploaded 2 yoga for computer users videos on YT

## June 29 
<b>Journal Entry</b><br>
Today I learned…
* MongoDB is used to store data put into a form into a cloud, very cool, put in quotes and MongoDB will put it in its database
* Git terminal commands, placed notes on my wall for creating a local repo, adding a remote repo, and logging local changes to the remote repo 
* Looking into  building our own data sources that we can build what we want with MongoDB
* Learning how to put data into a database
* We need to do two things to show quotes from MongoDB Atlas to our users.
- Get quotes from MongoDB Atlas.
- Rendering the quotes in HTML with a template engine

<b>Wins:</b>
* Used EJS to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript, got it to work by troubleshooting returned error message
* Figured out error message stopping local server from working (express.js not installed in the correct area, needed to be at the root of file)

<b>Struggles:</b>
Felt like I spent a lot of time on simple things and troubleshooting to figure out where to place files, but felt good I was able to figure out how to do most of the steps up to the point I stopped today, which is right before making the objects for the quotes.

<b>Notes:</b> Via B during silent study sesh chat-> ” video on installing Heroku CLI. I'd suggest watching it because that was my stumbling block yesterday and Monday.”
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1315269230
 
<b>Random Web app ideas:</b>
* Making this prettier in a nicer format web app with automated dates and generated areas of concern
* Tarot card web app: make flip of card happen on the server side instead of a coin flip

# To be continued
Although this concludes my first 6 months of formally learning full stack web development and 100+ days overall of the challenge, my #100daysofcode challenge continues! My posts have become more project-based as I start to finish front-end and backend builds I made over the course of this year.

I will be adding another series to finish up the challenge and share all of my more detailed journal entries in an upcoming post for those interested. <br><br>
Thanks for joining me on this journey, and see you on the next post!
