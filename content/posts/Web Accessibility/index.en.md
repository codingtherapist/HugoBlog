# Intro to Web Accessibility Testing Part 1

This is a 4 part live series on web accessibility covering automated and manual testing of web pages for web developers. Every Thursday at 12pm on Twitch :)

In this stream, we cover the basics of automated and manual web accessibility testing including general accessibility principles and how to get started with tools needed for testing websites. We cover screen readers, keyboard-only access, automated contrast checkers and browser extension while fixing a full stack web dev project built in html, css and javascript.
