Greetings code baddies and code daddys! 


It’s been a long and tumultuous journey through learning how to code using the MERN stack. What have I learned along the way? Way too much to wrap up in an article. 

If you're curious, feel free to check out my [Daily Coding Journal GitHub Repo](https://github.com/codingtherapist/daily-coding-journal) which details my first year of learning how to code and daily entries about my study plans and things I’ve learned.

I was inspired by a few mentors and friends to create a weekly vlog detailing what I’ve been working on, and how I’ve been feeling as I finish up my Software Engineering apprenticeship with 100Devs. In general, I have been wanting to work on increasing my ability with public speaking and getting more comfortable on camera. 

One of my colleagues from 100Devs started something called #100daysoncamera. This seemed like a pretty low stakes way to begin my journey of being more open and increasing my online presence in a meaningful way.

Though I won’t be doing daily videos, I *will* be doing weekly check-ins for anyone interested in what I have been learning. Below are the first two weeks. I started out only posting these to Twitter in 1-2 minute wrap-ups and have since changed the format for youtube and will be keeping it within 10-25 minutes each week.

 This format will be casual,  with pretty much no editing prior to uploading. I hope you enjoy this series and gain something of value from it, even just making you smile while I rant about data structures and algorithms. If you'd like to be notified (or just support) [subscribe to my channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiaMi-uLijoOEPT0lfaQCvw) :) 
 
 See you next week!
