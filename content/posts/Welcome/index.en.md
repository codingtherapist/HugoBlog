### Greetings! 

Welcome to my body of work. I'm excited to learn in public and share my web development journey with you!
 
ðŸŒ± My desire is to:
* share what I learn as I build full-stack web applications
* advocate for developer well-being and web accessibility
* build community using technology as a catalyst for connection
* apply my background as a therapist and problem solver to increase therapeutic uses of technology


 
ðŸŒ± This page will feature:
* education on web accessibility and assistive technology
* my journey through learning how to code as a community taught developer
* yoga tutorials for tech workers
 
Ultimately, Iâ€™d like to highlight the dynamic intersection of technology and health, while sharing everything I learn in between.
I hope you enjoy the ride!
